# Statistical Analysis with R

This repository contains analysis of my thesis 'Emerging modes of temporal coordination : Mandarin and non-native consonant clusters' using R.

## The statistical methods used in the current study are as follows: 

- Linear regression to study relationships between two continuous variables. 
- Generalised Linear Mixed-effects Models using a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach under a Bayesian statistical framework for multinomial data analysis.

## Libraries required for this analysis in R: 
- car
- plyr
- dplyr
- ggplot2
- lsr
- lme4
- lmerTest
- emmeans
- scales
- MASS
- MCMCglmm
